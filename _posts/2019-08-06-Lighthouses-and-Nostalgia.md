&hellip;I'll blame it on the late start, but I should have double-checked given how often it's happened - XSplit randomly switched audio inputs, so there's only my mic. No Discord. No background or game audio. Just me. :/

The idea was that today we would take a quick look at some updated redstone for the lighthouse, and then go on a fun trip through a bunch of old worlds and the two servers that preceded Season 00. Despite not having them on the live audio or recording, they were there and reveling in this trip down memory lane.

I'll publish a cut version of the tour or re-record as Episode 01 later this week or the next.
