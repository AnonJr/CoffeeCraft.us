We had our first live stream of Season 00!

Arcaidius and I got on the server, and our respective streaming accounts, and started a small project.

It was a bit of a learning experience as we had to troubleshoot some sound issues, ran into some dropped frames, and other minor problems. Some of the issues we've been able to fix, some I'm still working on, and some won't get fixed until we get newer server hardware&hellip;

I've embedded my video below, Arcaidius' video is up on [his Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/arcaidius_) for the next little bit. I will definitely be live next Monday around the same time, hopefully Arcaidius will be able to join me and we can manage to fit in the bandwidth available and with a better balance in the sound. :)
