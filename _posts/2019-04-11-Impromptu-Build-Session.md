Rayeste and I had a little extra time on hand, so we did a little resource gathering and planning in an impromptu build session. If YouTube will cooperate, the video should be available below&hellip; and speaking of YouTube, given some of the issues I've had lately, I think going forward I'll be live on Twitch and Mixer - and just use YouTube for the produced videos and live stream archive. I'll post more on that on [AnonJr.com](https://www.anonjr.com) at some point.
