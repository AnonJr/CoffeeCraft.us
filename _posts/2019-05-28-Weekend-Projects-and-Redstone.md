Just me this time, good or bad I leave that to you. :)

I do a quick run through of the various farms and upgrades that happened over the long weekend, we take a closer look at the now completed combo egg/chicken farm, and then start work on the redstone for Arcaidius' mob farm... and then promptly got stuck. I was able to figure it out the next day, so we'll go over it on next week's stream.
