## Updated to 1.15.2
After 1.15.2 was out and people had run it for a few weeks, we updated our server and so far it's been running great. We're still getting some laggy bits here and there, and after someone does an  extended AFK session we'll randomly stall when flying - but it is better than when we were running 1.15.1. Some of the YouTubers I watch are also having some issues (well, the ones that run on a server somewhere - the local single-players are doing just fine) so it may just be a problem with the 1.15.x server series. We've got a weekly reboot scheduled and so far that seems to keep things manageable.

## Datapack Updates
As before, we're still running a "vanilla" server in the sense that we're using the JAR from Mojang. We updated the datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) to the latest version of each (though at the time of posting it looks like I might need to update a couple more).

Here's the links if you want to play along with our current server setup:

 * [1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#CTebIH)
 * [1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#RJF2qf)
 * [1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#nEAEe4)

Vanilla Tweaks also added some custom trades for the Wandering Trader. I grabbed the datapack and edited it to offer our heads instead of the Hermit heads, and I kept in the mini-block trades. Seems to have been a *very* popular addition.

## OptiFine Testing
Some of us are also running a pre-release version of [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), and the most recent releases seem quite stable. I've been testing out the shader support, and it seems to be great (well... within the limits of my PC).
