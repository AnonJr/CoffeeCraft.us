Arcaidius was a little under the water so he didn't stream with me this go-round, but he was in chat. I made some more progress on the waterfall project, and got a rough start on the lake. Instead of making small steps on the same project each stream, I'll try to get a bit more done between now and next Monday. I don't want to kill this before it starts by grinding on the same project at glacial speeds&hellip; [GoodTimesWithScar](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoodTimesWithScar) makes this look so easy. :)

I finally got the audio issues worked out, and hopefully I'll have a post about that struggle over at [AnonJr.com](https://www.anonjr.com) sometime this week.

I've embedded my video below. I will definitely be live next Monday around the same time (7:00 PM EDT), hopefully Arcaidius will be able to join me. :)
