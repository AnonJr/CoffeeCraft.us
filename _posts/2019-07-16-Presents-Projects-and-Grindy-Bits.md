Today there's a quick summary of the new donations page at http://live.anonjr.com (powered by Stream Labs). Then we get to the present Arcaidius left outside my base. After that we do a quick tour of the progress on various projects around the server, finish up the mob dropper over by the guardian farm, and have a little fun for the last bit.

The unloading stations we looked at came from here:
