Today we give a quick look at the stations that were built between streams, and Rayeste and I start work on connecting two stations for part of our Elevated Rail ("The El"). It's a little quieter than usual as we both can either chat or keep from falling... just not both. :)

The rail station we're using is the one [designed by CobblestoneAndDirt](https://youtu.be/b3A9oAXJ5g4), I found out about it when Iskall85 built an earlier design on the HermitCraft server.
