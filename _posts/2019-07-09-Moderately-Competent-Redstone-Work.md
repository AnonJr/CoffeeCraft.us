We take a look at the mountain project, the upgrades to the main rail hub, and the changes to the nether tunnel that heads out to the guardian farm. After that we try to think out loud about building a collection system for the mob/sugar cane farm that's out by the latter, and talk about some news and lay the groundwork for what I mean by "moderately competent". :)

Here's the two videos I referenced:

 - [ImpulsSV's Sorters](https://youtu.be/IDmxkObgA2s)
