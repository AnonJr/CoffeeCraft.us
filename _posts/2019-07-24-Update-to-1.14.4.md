Now that 1.14.4 is out, and I've had a chance to install it with a little time before the next stream, we've updated to 1.14.4. It's supposed to have a ton of fixes for the villager issues, and we should now be able to set up a new proper Iron farm / trading hall / villager breeder. Though this go-round they may end up separate builds. We'll see.
