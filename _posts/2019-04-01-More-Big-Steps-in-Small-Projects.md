Arcaidius and I worked on a couple projects independently, he worked on some pixel art and I worked on the waterfall a bit. It was interesting working on different projects, but staying in the same chat.

We were able to fix some of the video issues, though the sound problems remain. Hopefully by next week's stream we'll have those worked out.

I've embedded my video below, and Arcaidius' video is up on [his Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/arcaidius_) for the next little bit. I will definitely be live next Monday around the same time (7:00 PM EDT), hopefully Arcaidius will be able to join me and we can manage to truly fix the sound. :)
