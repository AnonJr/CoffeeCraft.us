So &hellip; recently finished a test stream:

That's the end video (Or go [directly to the video](https://youtu.be/znUJW1QAy68) if the embed isn't working right). I hadn't been cleared for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw) streaming yet so it only went out live to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live) and [Mixer](https://mixer.com/AnonJr_Live?vod=91997262).

I'll be doing my first full CoffeeCraft stream on Monday March 25th at 7pm EDT (UTC-4 at the time of posting).

I'm using [Restream.io](https://restream.io) to simultaneously stream to [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live), [Mixer](https://mixer.com/AnonJr_Live?vod=91997262), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw) (where I'll also have the video available afterward). I've still got a few things I'd like to figure out and set up on XSplit. I am a little worried about the chat - Restream.io is supposed to cross-post all the chat messages so everyone sees everyone else's messages, but I'm wondering how moderation is going to work.

We shall see. See you Monday!
