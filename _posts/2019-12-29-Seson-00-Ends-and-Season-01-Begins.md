We've been talking about it off and on for the last few streams, and I wanted to get it in writing up on the (newly revamped) site, New Year's Eve we'll be live streaming the close of Season 00 and New Year's Day we'll be streaming the start of Season 01!

We've got a [new member]({% link _members/medic_frcg.md %}), and we're going to move to a new 1.15 world. I'll post the world seed and all that stuff later in the Seasons section.
