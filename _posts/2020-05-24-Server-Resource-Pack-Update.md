## Updated Resource Pack
We made a couple small changes to the resource pack we use on the server today. Most of the resources are still from VanillaTweaks, and can be had using this link: <https://vanillatweaks.net/share#BpsjBs>. Also from VanillaTweaks, we have the textures for the wrench and a couple other data pack related items.

What's new is a change to the Wolf - after grabbing a [texture from Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/black-lab-4559911/), our tamed wolves should look like Black Labs. It's one of those things we'd been talking about but never quite got around to it.

I also added my very first resource pack - some [custom villager voices](https://github.com/AnonJr/Minecraft-Villager-Voices/releases)! It's a very "version 1" bit of voice work, and is at this stage more for me to nail down the mechanics of how to build this sort of thing before I go through the time and work of scripting, recording, and editing something a little better. I should have a YouTube video recorded later, and I'll be uploading it to Planet Minecraft after that.
