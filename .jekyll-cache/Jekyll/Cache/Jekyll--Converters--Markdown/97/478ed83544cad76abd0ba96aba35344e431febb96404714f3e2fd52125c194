I"Ñ<p>Weâ€™ve been talking about it off and on for the last few streams, and I wanted to get it in writing up on the (newly revamped) site, New Yearâ€™s Eve weâ€™ll be live streaming the close of Season 00 and New Yearâ€™s Day weâ€™ll be streaming the start of Season 01!</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve got a <a href="/members/medic_frcg/">new member</a>, and weâ€™re going to move to a new 1.15 world. Iâ€™ll post the world seed and all that stuff later in the Seasons section.</p>
