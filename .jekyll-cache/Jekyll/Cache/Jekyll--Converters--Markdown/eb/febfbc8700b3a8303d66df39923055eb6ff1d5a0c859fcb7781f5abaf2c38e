<p>We made a couple small changes to the resource pack we use on the server today. Most of the resources are still from VanillaTweaks, and can be had using this link: <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#BpsjBs">https://vanillatweaks.net/share#BpsjBs</a>. Also from VanillaTweaks, we have the textures for the wrench and a couple other data pack related items.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs new is a change to the Wolf - after grabbing a <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/black-lab-4559911/">texture from Planet Minecraft</a>, our tamed wolves should look like Black Labs. It‚Äôs one of those things we‚Äôd been talking about but never quite got around to it.</p>

<p>I also added my very first resource pack - some <a href="https://github.com/AnonJr/Minecraft-Villager-Voices/releases">custom villager voices</a>! It‚Äôs a very ‚Äúversion 1‚Äù bit of voice work, and is at this stage more for me to nail down the mechanics of how to build this sort of thing before I go through the time and work of scripting, recording, and editing something a little better. I should have a YouTube video recorded later, and I‚Äôll be uploading it to Planet Minecraft after that.</p>
