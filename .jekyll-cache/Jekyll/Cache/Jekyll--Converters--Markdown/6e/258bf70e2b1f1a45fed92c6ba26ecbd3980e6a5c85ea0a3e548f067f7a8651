I"ø<h2 id="updated-to-1152">Updated to 1.15.2</h2>
<p>After 1.15.2 was out and people had run it for a few weeks, we updated our server and so far itâ€™s been running great. Weâ€™re still getting some laggy bits here and there, and after someone does an  extended AFK session weâ€™ll randomly stall when flying - but it is better than when we were running 1.15.1. Some of the YouTubers I watch are also having some issues (well, the ones that run on a server somewhere - the local single-players are doing just fine) so it may just be a problem with the 1.15.x server series. Weâ€™ve got a weekly reboot scheduled and so far that seems to keep things manageable.</p>

<h2 id="datapack-updates">Datapack Updates</h2>
<p>As before, weâ€™re still running a â€œvanillaâ€ server in the sense that weâ€™re using the JAR from Mojang. We updated the datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> to the latest version of each (though at the time of posting it looks like I might need to update a couple more).</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the links if you want to play along with our current server setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#CTebIH">1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#RJF2qf">1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#nEAEe4">1.15.2 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Vanilla Tweaks also added some custom trades for the Wandering Trader. I grabbed the datapack and edited it to offer our heads instead of the Hermit heads, and I kept in the mini-block trades. Seems to have been a <em>very</em> popular addition.</p>

<h2 id="optifine-testing">OptiFine Testing</h2>
<p>Some of us are also running a pre-release version of <a href="https://optifine.net/home">OptiFine</a>, and the most recent releases seem quite stable. Iâ€™ve been testing out the shader support, and it seems to be great (wellâ€¦ within the limits of my PC).</p>
