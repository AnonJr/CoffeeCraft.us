<p>Season 01, new year, new server, new member - started on 01 Jan 2020, on a fresh 1.15.1 server with the seed <em>1057265842</em>. Weâ€™re still running on the hosting package by <a href="https://cubedhost.com/">CubedHost</a> as itâ€™s been a great experience so far (other than some self-inflicted issues). <a href="/seasons/season00/">Season 00</a> was a great starter/learning season, now  we start for realz. :)</p>

<p>This is also the season that our good friend <a href="/members/medic_frcg/">Medic_FRCG</a> joins the server.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re still running a â€œvanillaâ€ server in the sense that weâ€™re using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> to round off a few edges.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the links if you want to play along with our current 1.16.0 server setup:</p>

<p>Some of us are also running the pre-release <a href="https://optifine.net/home">OptiFine</a>, and a few custom additional textures.</p>

      <p>Weâ€™ve been using the <a href="http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#gravestones">Player Graves datapack that VooDooBeard built</a> instead of the Vanilla Tweaks one due to some issues in the current version. Weâ€™ll look at going back when itâ€™s been updated. We also customized the Wandering Trader to use our heads instead of the Hermit heads.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
