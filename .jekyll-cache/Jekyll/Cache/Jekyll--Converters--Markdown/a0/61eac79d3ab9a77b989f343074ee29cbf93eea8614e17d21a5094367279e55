I"á	<p>So with the release of 1.13 weâ€™re beginning a new server and beginning to give something back under the banner of â€œCoffeeCraftâ€. CoffeeCraft is a small, family run survival Minecraft server that <a href="/members/rayeste/">my sister</a>, <a href="/members/arcaidius/">her husband</a>, <a href="/members/anonjr/">and I</a> founded. Inspired by <a href="http://hermitcraft.com/">HermitCraft</a>, weâ€™re ready to start something new.</p>

<p>The first run of videos/live streams are going to be our â€œSeason 00â€, a beta season. Mostly this season is about changing the way we work together in a more stream-friendly way (a little more space between builds, making sure weâ€™re always chatting via Discord, etc.), getting our recording and streaming gear in order, and working through building channels on Twitch/Mixer/YouTube. Each memberâ€™s page has where to find each of us.</p>

<p>We are starting Season 00 with the release of 1.13 on a local server (AnonJrâ€™s old <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/alienware-m17x-r4/manuals">Alienware M17x R4</a> for the curious) with the seed <em>-1872826417</em>. Itâ€™s a Vanilla server in the sense that itâ€™s using the server JAR straight from Mojang, though if you consider the use of data-packs and custom recipes â€œnot vanillaâ€ then weâ€™re more â€œvanilla adjacentâ€â€¦ :)</p>

<p>The data-packs and recipes are mostly from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> and <a href="http://mc.voodoobeard.com/">VoodooBeard</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One Player Sleep (Canâ€™t remember where I found this oneâ€¦)</li>
  <li>Anti-Ender Grief (VoodooBeard)</li>
  <li>Gravestones (VoodooBeard)</li>
  <li>Mob Muffler (VoodooBeard)</li>
  <li>Zombie Leather (VoodooBeard)</li>
  <li>AFK Name Display (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Double Shulker Shells (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Double Slab Crafting (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Dragon Drops Elytra (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Mob Silencer (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>More Mob Heads (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Redstone Rotation Wrench (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Terracotta Rotation Wrench (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
  <li>Universal Dyeing (Vanilla Tweaks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m also running a texture pack consisting of the 1.14 beta textures (and will be keeping it up as theyâ€™re released), and a few items from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a>. Because of the custom textures needed for a couple items, itâ€™s also set as the server texture pack.</p>
