I"—<p>Small update again. If youâ€™ve been watching the live streams, youâ€™ll know that weâ€™ve been having problems with the Player Graves datapack again. Weâ€™re at the point where the next â€œfixâ€ involves completely nuking the Player Data/Advancements/etc.â€¦</p>

<p>Since that was a step too far, weâ€™ve removed the Vanilla Tweaks version of Player Graves and installed the <a href="http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#gravestones">Player Graves datapack that VooDooBeard built</a>. Itâ€™s a little full-circle, since his datapack was the one we started Season 00 with before moving everything to the Vanilla Tweaks versions.</p>

<p>On the one hand, weâ€™ll be missing some features - on the other we shouldnâ€™t be missing any items. We hope.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t update the Vanilla Tweaks link on the <a href="/seasons/season00/">Seaon 01 page</a> to one that doesnâ€™t include Player Graves because Iâ€™d like to switch back once itâ€™s updated. Theyâ€™re tied up in other updates and donâ€™t currently have the time to do the level of troubleshooting that Player Graves would require (totally understand - I worked on a sizeable internal software project at my previous job).</p>

<p>Time management hasnâ€™t been my best suit this year, but if I can Iâ€™m going to dust off my â€œprogrammerâ€ hat and see what I can figure out. If nothing else, it will be a chance to finally learn more about how to program data packs. :)</p>
