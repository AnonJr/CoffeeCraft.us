I"É<h2 id="updated-to-116">Updated to 1.16!</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s finally here! And after giving it a few days to make sure no one ran into weird issues, weâ€™ve installed the update ourselves. All those new blocksâ€¦ good thing we reserved space in the storage system. :smiley:</p>

<p>Get ready for an interesting livestream on Tuesday. Iâ€™ll have the archive up on my YouTube channel if you donâ€™t have the opportunity to watch live.</p>

<p>Just a reminder, weâ€™re still running a â€œvanillaâ€ server in the sense that weâ€™re using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> to round off a few edges.</p>

<h2 id="updated-datapacks-crafting-tweaks-and-textures">Updated Datapacks, Crafting Tweaks, and Textures</h2>
<p>Speaking of which, I went to the Vanilla Tweaks website and grabbed updated versions of almost all the datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resource packs that we use from them.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the links if you want to play along with our current server setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#LZp0K0">1.16.1 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#bFrTnQ">1.16.1 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#BpsjBs">1.16.1 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve updated the Vanilla Tweaks link on the <a href="/seasons/season01/">Season 01 page</a>. As noted before, weâ€™re still using the <a href="http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#gravestones">Player Graves datapack that VooDooBeard built</a> instead of the Vanilla Tweaks one due to some issues in the current version. Weâ€™ll look at going back when itâ€™s been updated. Iâ€™ve also added the <a href="http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#death_book">Death Book/Message from VooDooBeard</a> as well, since one of the features weâ€™ve been missing from the old Graves datapack was the message in chat with the location you died at.</p>

<p>We customized the Wandering Trader to use our heads instead of the Hermit heads.</p>

<p>We added the Coordinates HUD datapack to the server. Everyone is now on board with getting coordinates and not blocking most of the screen with debug text.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also using a few extra textures thatâ€™s not a part of the main CoffeeCraft Texture Pack. While trying to stick to the original goal of keeping as close to â€œvanillaâ€ as possible, these scratch a few itches that bug me personally, but not the other server members. If you want to see what Iâ€™m choosing to add, you can see most of â€œAnonJrâ€™s Extra Texturesâ€ here: https://vanillatweaks.net/share#gql07Y</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got a few extra Datapacks that I run in my creative testing world, mostly so I can check and assess various bits. Theyâ€™re not really appropriate to run on the server as they donâ€™t help/enhance the survival experience. For the curious, you can find â€œAnonJrâ€™s Creative Extrasâ€ here: https://vanillatweaks.net/share#1xZp5s</p>

<h2 id="no-optifine-for-a-bit">No OptiFine for a bitâ€¦</h2>
<p>Some of us were running the 1.15.2 betas of <a href="https://optifine.net/home">OptiFine</a>, but sadly thereâ€™s no 1.16 (beta or otherwise) just yet.</p>
