<p>Season 01, new year, new server, new member - started on 01 Jan 2020, on a fresh 1.15.1 server with the seed <em>1057265842</em>. Weâ€™re still running on the hosting package by <a href="https://cubedhost.com/">CubedHost</a> as itâ€™s been a great experience so far (other than some self-inflicted issues). <a href="/seasons/season00/">Season 00</a> was a great starter/learning season, now  we start for realz. :)</p>

<p>This is also the season that our good friend <a href="/members/medic_frcg/">Medic_FRCG</a> joins the server.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re still running a â€œvanillaâ€ server in the sense that weâ€™re using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/">Vanilla Tweaks</a> to round off a few edges.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the links if you want to play along with our current server setup:</p>

  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#o2rdpT">1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#t5got3">1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/share#nEAEe4">1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of us are also running <a href="https://optifine.net/home">OptiFine</a> (well, we were as soon as the 1.15 client was released), and a few custom additional textures.</p>
