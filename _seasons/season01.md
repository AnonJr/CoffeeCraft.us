## New Year, New Season, New Member
Season 01, new year, new server, new member - started on 01 Jan 2020, on a fresh 1.15.1 server with the seed *1057265842*. We're still running on the hosting package by [CubedHost](https://cubedhost.com/) as it's been a great experience so far (other than some self-inflicted issues). [Season 00]({% link _seasons/season00.md %}) was a great starter/learning season, now  we start for realz. :)

This is also the season that our good friend [Medic_FRCG]({% link _members/medic_frcg.md %}) joins the server.

We're still running a "vanilla" server in the sense that we're using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) to round off a few edges.

Here's the links if you want to play along with our current server setup:

 * [1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#o2rdpT)
 * [1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#t5got3)
 * [1.15.1 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#nEAEe4)

Some of us are also running [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) (well, we were as soon as the 1.15 client was released), and a few custom additional textures.
