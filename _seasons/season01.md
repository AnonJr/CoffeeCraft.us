## New Year, New Season, New Member
Season 01, new year, new server, new member - started on 01 Jan 2020, on a fresh 1.15.1 server with the seed *1057265842*. We're still running on the hosting package by [CubedHost](https://cubedhost.com/) as it's been a great experience so far (other than some self-inflicted issues). [Season 00]({% link _seasons/season00.md %}) was a great starter/learning season, now  we start for realz. :)

This is also the season that our good friend [Medic_FRCG]({% link _members/medic_frcg.md %}) joins the server.

We're still running a "vanilla" server in the sense that we're using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) to round off a few edges.

We updated to 1.16.2 on 22 August 2020. Here's the links if you want to play along with our current 1.16.2 server setup:

 * [1.16.2 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#0RjgAk)[^1]
 * [1.16.2 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#bFrTnQ)
 * [1.16.2 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#0jwHZf)[^2]

We're using a selection of Datapacks from VooDooBeard as well:

 * [Beehive Lore](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#beehive_lore)
 * [Climbable Chains](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#climbable_chains)
 * [Death Notification](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#death_book)
 * [Player Graves](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#gravestones)
 * [Trader Notifications](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#trader_notify)

Some of us are also running the pre-release [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), and a few custom additional textures.

[^1]: We're still using the [Player Graves datapack that VooDooBeard built](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#gravestones) instead of the Vanilla Tweaks one, even though there's a new version that should be fixed. This one is working well enough, so we're not going to change it for now. We also customized the Wandering Trader to use our heads instead of the Hermit heads.

[^2]: We're running a few additional textures, some AnonJr created and some came from elsewhere. More information and the full server pack is at the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCraft/CoffeeCraft-Texture-Pack/releases/tag/1.16.2v1).
