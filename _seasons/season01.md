## New Year, New Season, New Member
Season 01, new year, new server, new member - started on 01 Jan 2020, on a fresh 1.15.1 server with the seed *1057265842*. We're still running on the hosting package by [CubedHost](https://cubedhost.com/) as it's been a great experience so far (other than some self-inflicted issues). [Season 00]({% link _seasons/season00.md %}) was a great starter/learning season, now  we start for realz. :)

This is also the season that our good friend [Medic_FRCG]({% link _members/medic_frcg.md %}) joins the server.

We're still running a "vanilla" server in the sense that we're using the JAR from Mojang. We are using a few datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) to round off a few edges.

We updated to 1.16.5 on 31 January 2021. Here's the links if you want to play along with our current 1.16.2 server setup:

 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#dmMYSP)[^1]
 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#P0DtdL)
 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#lBPrXr)[^2]

We're using a selection of Datapacks from VooDooBeard as well:

 * [Beehive Lore](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#beehive_lore)
 * [Climbable Chains](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#climbable_chains)
 * [Trader Notifications](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#trader_notify)

Some of us are also running the pre-release [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), and a few custom additional textures.

[^1]: We customized the Wandering Trader to use our heads instead of the Hermit heads. This link includes the "Blocks Only" version of the Wandering Trader.

[^2]: We're running a few additional textures, some AnonJr created and some came from elsewhere. More information and the full server pack is at the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCraft/CoffeeCraft-Texture-Pack/releases/tag/1.16.5v1).
