## The "Beta" season.
We're starting with Season 00, where we're still running 1.13 on a local server (my old Alienware M17x R4 for the curious). Mostly we're finding our feet working together in a more stream-friednly way (a little more space between builds, making sure we're always chatting via Discord, etc.), and working through building channels. See each member's page for who's where.
