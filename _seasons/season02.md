## Skyblock Interlude
We planned the end of [Season 01]({% link _seasons/season01.md %}) for when 1.17 launched. The intent was to enjoy some new Caves and Cliffs and all the things that went along with them&hellip; and then the update got split. So, we're still starting a new season - but it's going to be a chance to play some Skyblock. We've all mostly played vanilla Minecraft (except Arcaidius - he's played a fair amount of Pixelmon), so this is a chance to try something new.

We're using the relatively simple [uSkyBlock Revived](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/uskyblock-revived.66795/) on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/). Other than the required plug-ins, we're also using [CustomOreGen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customoregen.9532/) to keep the block acquisition process from getting too grindy. Unfortunately uSkyBlock Revived hasn't been updated to 1.17 yet, so we're not going to be able to use any of the new blocks this go-round.

Because we're still in 1.16.5, we're using the same datapacks, crafting tweaks, and resources from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) that we used in Season 01; with the minor addition of less streaky glass and the addition of the Durability Ping datapack.

Here's the updated links if you want to play along with our current 1.16.5 server setup:

 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Datapack selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#1yZFNM)[^1]
 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Crafting selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#P0DtdL)
 * [1.16.5 Vanilla Tweaks Texture selection](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#B0sr4Q)[^2]

We're using a selection of datapacks from VooDooBeard as well: [^3]

 * [Beehive Lore](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#beehive_lore)
 * [Climbable Chains](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#climbable_chains)
 * [Trader Notifications](http://mc.voodoobeard.com/#trader_notify)

Some of us are also running [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), and a few custom additional textures.

[^1]: We customized the Wandering Trader to use our heads instead of the Hermit heads. This link includes the "Blocks Only" version of the Wandering Trader.

[^2]: We're running a few additional textures, some AnonJr created and some came from elsewhere. More information and the full server pack is at the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CoffeeCraft/CoffeeCraft-Texture-Pack/releases/tag/1.16.5v4).

[^3]: I haven't updated to the latest version of these packs though&hellip; VooDooBeard changed the download service he uses, and I'm not about to install a required plug-in for the service he selected. I may have to find an alternative later on.
